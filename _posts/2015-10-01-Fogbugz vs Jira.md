## Fogbugz vs Jira

Prashant Deva wrote an interesting post comparing the success of two SaaS bug tracking platforms [Why Fogbugz lost to Jira](http://movingfulcrum.com/why-fogbugz-lost-to-jira/). Among many reasons he calls out, there is an intersting pricing note.

> Fogbugz's free license only allows 2 users, making it basically useless.
> Jira's starter edition allows 10 users, making it actually usable as a starting tier. While they do charge a token $10 instead of Free, that is to keep non-serious users away and also established it as real 'paid' tier.
> To compare, Fogbugz's 10 user edition currently costs $100/month.
> A full order of magnitude costlier! At this much price difference, it is very, very tough for startups to chose Fogbugz over Jira at this tier.

**Jira charges a token $10 instead of Free, to keep non-serious users away and also established it as real 'paid' tier.**

So if have an allergy to giving away your software for free, here is a successful B2B SaaS company without a free account.
