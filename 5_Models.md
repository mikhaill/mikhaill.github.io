(This is just notes for now).
The freemium model was always based on "give away" the product, but for it to actually be useful, you have to pay. So anyone who tried the free version came away disillusioned about what the tool or product could actually do, and those who realized they needed to pay for the useful features came away feeling ripped off because "it's supposed to be free."
