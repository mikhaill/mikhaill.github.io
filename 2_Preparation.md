> **Key Points**

> 1. You need to know the value propostion of your product

> 2. Switching costs and barriers are key part of determining correct pricing

> 3. Signs that your pricing is making sense

Once you know how your product is positioned in the market, and have identified your ideal customer, you need to understand the following information about your customers and your product.

**What is the purpose of your product?**

- Save money
- Grow sales
- Increase efficiency
- Staff happiness
- Other _(If so, please let me know what that is, so I can add it to this list)_

If your product promises to grow sales or cut costs, this is very easy for the customer to quantify and people are more willing spend money when they can quickly figure out if the results are there.  As long as your price is less then the value to the customer, in theory, they would be willing to pay that. Don't be afraid to think about a higher price point since you’ll know exactly how much value you’re providing to the customer.

> Example: There is an industry in helping shippers automatically get refunds for late or mishandled packages from UPS and FedEx. The pricing is always a percentage of the money recovered. It's the perfect: we charge you slightly less than the value to you.

Staff happiness and increasing efficiency is typically hard to quantify, and often prospects balk at buying a product that doesn’t offer a clear ROI they can put a number on. Imagine going to your boss for approval to purchase something and the boss asks "Great, if we spend this $500, how can we track the results?"  If this is your value proposition, consider for your pricing to have low upfront cost or an easy way to get prospects comfortable trying the product - but not for free. We'll address the "Free" pricing later on. 

**Switching Costs and Barriers**

- Is your product something that’s extremely sticky and hard to migrate from once people start using it? 
- Is there a lot of up front work that requires an implementation process? 
- How is easy is it to migrate from a competitor to your product?

If your product is extremely sticky, meaning once people start using it, it’s hard for them to move then the pricing needs to encourage people to get started. Consider a free trial, help onboarding, or anything else that encourage people to get started. This is especially true if the signup and launch process is completely automated and there is no customer configuration or onboarding process required.  

> I once had a number of conversations with an enterprise SaaS vendor that sold a product starting at $10,000 per year range and it probably saved their customers much more than that. They had the perfect SaaS setup, where onboarding was competly automated and their costs for a new account were negligible. They didn't offer a self-serve trial option at any cost (free, highlighy discounted, etc). They ended up going out of business. Now, this isn't the reason the company failed, but if it costs you $0 to offer a test drive, you should consider having the option. This will help you build your sales pipeline and potentially close more business.


If the product requires lots of upfront configuration, integration into other systems, etc consider having an implementation fee. This is something that businesses are used to because they require lots of handholding during the launch process to make sure it goes smoothly and doesn’t disrupt their operations. You also don’t want to lose money when launching clients. The implementation fee should cover your cost but should not be prohibitive. If you're going to spend time and resources to get a customer to launch, you want them to have skin in the game by committing some cash upfront. 

> If your product requires integrations and configuration, consider having a project plan you can present to the prospects. This will show them what they are getting as part of the onboarding and launch process and will help you justify the value. This will also help you clarify any assumptions the prospect had about the launch and minimize the "Wait, I thought I was getting an integration into my accounting system as part of this" difficult conversations.

As you begin the journey to come up with the pricing plan and ideas start to bubble up, here are the signs that you’re on the right path:

1. Predictable, recurring revenue
2. Revenue increases as users increase engagement  
3. Your cost of serving customers go down
