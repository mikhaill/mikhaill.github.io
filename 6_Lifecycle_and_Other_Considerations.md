This is more of a collections of a number of small and quick ideas to keep in mind before you get to the actual pricing considerations.

### What else is the customer buying?
One of the key customer insights that many miss, is to find out what else the customer is paying for and see if you can back out some of their descisions based on that. As an example, let's say you are targetting e-commerce retailers. E-commerce shopping carts generally come in two options 

1. Hosted - (BigCommerce, Shopify) - The cart is entire hosted for the retailer. They are sacrificing some flexibiltiy in exchange for not having their own development/IT staff and infrastructure. They are low startup costs and monthly fees.
2. Owned - (Magento) - The cart code is provided to the merchant who customizes and hosts it themselves. This generally requires them to have their own hardware and staff to manage the cart. However, once the cart is licensed there is no more payments to the cart developer.

So, just by asking your potential customers what else they've bought you can make key descisions based on those insights. By asking what cart the are running you just backed out the following information:

- Do they have IT staff and infrustructure?
-- Which actually also leads to overall budget estimates
- Are they willing to spend money to get projects off the ground
- Do they prefer to sacrificy features for "it just works"
- Are they open to a monthly rev share fee or prefer licensing
- What kind of sales process they are familiar with
-- Magento is high-touch, sales person driven
-- Shopify is self-serve signup
   

### Implication of Descisions

- Are you interested in a business with fewer, higher margin customers or a mass, lower margin offering
- You pricing point will determine wether you need a no-touch, low-touch or a high-touch sales operation.
-- Some products, due to complexity, even at low cost require human touch
