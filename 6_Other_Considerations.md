This is a collections of a few quick ideas to keep in mind before you get to the actual pricing considerations.

### What else is the customer buying?
One of the key customer insights that many miss, is to find out what else the customer is paying for and see if you can back out some of their decisions based on that. As an example, let's say you are targeting e-commerce retailers. E-commerce shopping carts generally come in two options 

1. Hosted - (BigCommerce, Shopify) - The cart is entire hosted for the retailer. They are sacrificing some flexibility in exchange for not having their own development/IT staff and infrastructure. These products have low startup costs and monthly fees are often based on revenue share, attracting newer / smaller businesses.
2. Owned - (Magento) - The cart code is licensed  to the merchant who customizes and hosts it themselves. This generally requires them to have their own hardware and staff to manage the cart or pay someone to do it for them. This generally attracts bigger merchants with a budet for software.

Just by asking your potential customers what else they've bought or what platforms they have in place, you can make key decisions based on those insights. By asking what cart they are using, you just backed out the following information:

- Do they have IT staff and infrastructure?
-- Which actually also leads to overall budget estimates
- Are they willing to spend money to get projects off the ground
- Do they prefer to sacrifice features for "it just works"
- Are they open to a monthly rev share fee or prefer licensing fees
- What kind of sales process they are familiar with
-- Magento is high-touch, sales person driven
-- Shopify is self-serve signup
   

### Implication of Decisions

Be careful of pricing getting too complex. You can maximize revenue by segmenting your customer base, but the way you gate your product needs to be conveyed clearly in the prices.  As you segment your pricing remember, price sensitive customers get limited plans, value sensitive customers get the VIP plan. 

Too few tiers leaves cash on the table but too many tiers are just as bad at confusing customers.

You pricing point will determine wether you need a no-touch, low-touch or a high-touch sales operation. Are you interested in a business with fewer, high margin customers or a mass, lower margin offering?
