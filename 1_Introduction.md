> **Key Points**

> 1.   Before you can determine pricing, you need to determine product positioning.

> 2.   Pricing has to work for the business, the customer and be consistant with product positioning.

> 3.   Pricing will evolve and need to be adjusted as you learn from your prospects and your business. 

Developing a proper pricing structure for B2B SaaS software products is complicated. Pricing has many requirements, and figuring out how to get it right is not easy. It takes plenty of trial and errors. Getting pricing correct is extremely important because it will determines the length of your sales cycle, who the decision makers are, your position in the marketplace, sets customers expectations and has to keep you profitable.

SaaS solutions are attractive to customers because they reduce the upfront investment and avoid the ongoing costs of maintaining the hardware and the software. With a SaaS solution, those costs and risks are transferred to the software developer, so it’s important that the pricing structure accounts for this.

Pricing also has to work for all the stakeholders:

- Prospects and Customers – It has to align with your customers business models
- Messaging – Pricing messages to prospects what kind of customer you’re looking for and it has to align with your product marketing message
- Market Position – Competition, substitutions and customer’s lifecycle have to be taken into account for setting your pricing. 
- Changes – Customers do not like change, especially when it’s a price increase

There is no simple formula or a 3-step process to help with pricing you product. I hope to show the different approaches and implications of various decisions to help you form a solid foundation for coming up with a pricing strategy for your products.   

The one assumption I’m making is that you already know the product positioning for your offering.

Before we can talk pricing, there needs to be a clear product marketing position that pricing supports. If you haven’t figured out your product positioning, do it now, because a misalignment between pricing and position will quickly kill your sales.

> If you don't take product positioning seriously, if will most likely kill your startup. Check out some startup post mortems [here](https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/startup-failure-post-mortem/) or [here](http://autopsy.io/) and look at the most common reason for failure. It's the "Lack of product to market fit". Which is generally the result product marketing failure.

Product positioning is an important part of a product marketing strategy.  If you try to be everything to everyone, you may not succeed with anyone.  A specific position helps buyers understand where the product fits in terms what it offers, and how it compares with the competition. 

As an example, let’s look at the e-mail service space for an example of product positioning:

- [Listrak](http://www.listrak.com) -  has positioned themselves as e-mail for e-commerce merchants and retailers
- [Mad Mimi](http://www.madmimi.com) - focuses on offering a simple way to create branded, well-designed newsletters
- [HubSpot](http://www.hubspot.com) - focuses on helping businesses do inbound marketing and generate sales leads
- [Marketo](http://www.marketo.com) - positioned itself as the platform for nurturing prospects to deal close and customer loyalty

As you can see, all of the companies here are e-mail services providers and probably have a large overlap in their features. However, by positioning their product for a specific niche, and tweaking their specific features they are able to carve out a space to operate and generate profits from it.

If you haven’t thought about product positioning, now is the time to do it.  There are many other wonderful resources on product positioning and marketing.

Let me give you two warning as you think about your product positioning. **Do not let pricing be your differentiation.** There will always be someone who will find a way to undercut you and offer a similar set of features cheaper than you can.  Please try to find a different way to position yourself other than price.

**Have a clear decision on if you’re going to be a premium product in the marketplace or not.**  A premium product may require a sales team, which means additional hiring, costs, commission, etc. A premium product also comes with certain assumptions about account managers, phone support, etc. This isn’t to discourage you from pricing at a premium, just be aware of the implications.

Pricing before the product is launched is more art then science. There are more unknown values in your equiation than known numbers. The goal of here is to at least point you in the right direction and avoid a major mistake.
