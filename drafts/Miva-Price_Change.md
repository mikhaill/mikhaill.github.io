## A Price Increase 

Recently, Miva an e-commerce shopping cart, [announced a price change](http://www.miva.com/miva-pricing-update) for their customers. 

Historically, Miva charged customers based on the number of seats (users) and storage/bandwidth the store used, regardless of volume of sales.

As part of the announcement Miva explained that
> We've always let our customers choose whatever plan they wanted to use for their business, regardless of the size of their business.... The outcome of this legacy policy has been that, in some cases, very large stores attempt to "squeeze" into hosting accounts designed for stores a fraction of their size...

The new pricing continued to be based on bandwidth/stores use, however, it also added another level of differentiation: annual revenue processed on the platform.  I'm citing a portion of their new pricing to make this easy to discuss.

Where as before, whether you were doing $10 in revenue or $100,000,000 in revenue as long as your usage fit the plan you paid the same, now you get bumped into a higher plan. This forced many into paying significantly more. It's no surprise that some of the user feedback has been:

> A 150% price increase? That's ridiculous......  

>  Do you realize how impractical it is to ask a business with a gross revenue of 100K to pay 250 a month? Most likely their profit margins are already minimal - could be 30K of profit, and less minus operating expenses.

> My monthly bill for one website is going from roughly $90 a month to $1,500 A MONTH?? The other from $49 to $249??

What can we learn from this ?

- Price sensitivity. As I wrote in my [Customer Budgets](/3_Budgets/), you need to know the budget of your customers. Historically, Miva has always targeted the smaller merchant that is intensely price sensitive. 
	- I also wrote about knowing your customer P&L. Some merchants net margins are so thin that a $500 annual cost difference is a big deal to them.
	- Perhaps Miva did this on purpose to get rid of some of the smaller customers, but realistically, when doing a price increase, having the price jump 10x or more is generally not going to be received well by the customers. 
- Pricing dictates the customers you get. Miva has always targeted the price conscious customers and now they are proposing a huge price increase to them, which many of them just can't absorb. This pricing structure goes directly against their market positioning.
- Giving customers 30 day notice to such a dramatic price change further negatively effects the company perception.
