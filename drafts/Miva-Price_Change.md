## A Price Increase 

Recently, Miva an e-commerce shopping cart [announced a price change](http://www.miva.com/miva-pricing-update) for their customers. 

Historically, Miva charged customers based on the number of seats (users) and storage/bandwidth the store used, regardless of volume of sales.

As part of the announcement Miva explained that
> We've always let our customers choose whatever plan they wanted to use for their business, regardless of the size of their business.... The outcome of this legacy policy has been that, in some cases, very large stores attempt to "squeeze" into hosting accounts designed for stores a fraction of their size...

The new pricing continued to be based on bandwidth/stores use, however, it also has another level of differentiation - Annual Revenue processed on the platform.  I'm citing a portion of their new pricing to make it easy to discuss.

What this did, was forced merchants that were doing significant volume through the platform but using some of the cheapest use packages to be forced into paying significantly more. It's no surprise that some of the user feedback has been:

> A 150% price increase? That's ridiculous......  
> In my business, $1 million in sales nets about $40,000 in profit after all the expenses are paid.....
> My monthly bill for one website is going from roughly $90 a month to $1,500 A MONTH?? The other from $49 to $249?? 

- Price sensitivity. As I talked in my [Customer Budgets](/3_Budgets/), when you need to know the budget of your customers. Historically, Miva has always targeted the smaller merchant, who is intensely price sensitive. A pricing jump 3x to 10x is the same thing as firing customers.
- In the same breath I also talk about knowing your customer P&L. Some merchants net margins are so thin that a $500 annual cost difference is a big deal to them
