> **Key Points**
> 1.   Learn how your competition is positioning their products. Often you can see their strategy from the pricing.
> 2.   Look for gaps in their pricing and figure out why they are there.


The next step in the process will be evaluating the competitor pricings strategies and a framework for organizing them. It’s not enough just to find out what the competitor is charging, but it’s important to understand the drivers of their pricing and how they put together their pricing packages. 

The most common pricing strategies include:

**Freemium** - offers basic services or features for free and charges for more sophisticated components. The general idea is that instead of expensive sales and marketing efforts, a company wants to create a low barrier for interested customers to sample their offering. The free plan is usually limited on a time basis, limited features, capacity or use case basis.	 You should also note if any competitors offer a free forever plan. 

The freemium model was always based on "give away" the product, but for it to actually be useful, you have to pay. We'll get into the pros and cons of a freemium model in the business scenario later.

**Pay as You Go** – Plans that grow based on use (transactions) or capacity (storage used) of the product.  Generally, it’s tierd plans, the more the client uses, the less they pay per unit. It’s important to 

**User Based** – Pricing based on number of users allowed to use the software at the same time.

**License Fee** - Pricing tiers based on access to certain features but not scaled based on actual usage of users in the system.

Additionally, note if your competition basing their pricing on:

-Set license fee vs revenue share
	-Example: $399/month or 2% of revenue
-Number of users / seats
	-Example: $10 for up to 3 users
-Specific features locked / unlocked
   -Example: You get X in the basic package but X and Y in the advanced package 
-Transactions / Actions Performed
   -Example: 100,000 emails per month
-Support tiers
    -Example: Forum, Email, Phone, SLA
-Training
-Integrations into 3rd parties and API access

> Pricing model sends a very specific message to the prospect.

- **License Free vs Revenue Share**
    - Revenue share is always attractive to the SMB as they don’t have to commit payment for something that may not work for them or something that may take a while for them to ramp up to get full use.  They are much happier to pay for something after they’ve made money as a direct result of using the product. 
    - An established company, with budgets and managers approval, that’s already doing significanty volume isn’t interesting in giving up 1% of their revenue. It’s almost a non-starter for them.  They want to know what their monthly fee is going to be, so they can budget for it and expect to pay it every month. 

- **Transaction Tiers**
	- Transactions / Actions Performed signals exactly what kind of company is in your sweet spot for support.  Let’s say you break up your pricing package to  be
    - Entry: Up to 1,000 transactions
    - Growth: Up to 5,000 transactions
    - Plus: Up to 10,000 transactions

This means that if I’m a smaller business, doing 200 – 800 transactions a month I may look and think that you’re too big for me since I fall to the smaller side of your smallest plan. On the other other hand, if I am a big customer, I see that your max plan is 10,000 and even if you have a note “for larger customers call us” I know that if I am doing 20,000 transactions, I’m twice your largest package and I can assume you may struggle to support me from a technology and other standpoint.
