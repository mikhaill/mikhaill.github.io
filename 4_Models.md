title: 4. Pricing Models and Framework

> **Key Points**

> 1. Learn how your competition is positioning their products. Often you can see their strategy from the pricing.

> 2. Look for gaps in their pricing and figure out why they are there.

The next step in the process will be evaluating the competitor pricings strategies and a framework for organizing them. It’s not enough just to find out what the competitor is charging, but it’s important to understand the drivers of their pricing and how they put together their pricing packages. 

The most common pricing strategies include:

**Freemium** - Offer basic services or limited features for free and charges for more sophisticated components or more usage. **Note at which size/feature the customers are forced to change to a paid plan**.

**Pay as You Go** – Plans that grow based on use (transactions) or capacity (storage used) of the product.  Generally, the more the client uses, the less they pay per unit. **Note what the tiers are.** This sends an important message to the prospects. If your top tier maxes out at 1000 widgets and I deal with 10,000 widgets, I may assume that I'm too big for your product.

**User Based** – Pricing based on number of users allowed to use the software at the same time.

**License Fee** - Pricing tiers based on access to certain features but not scaled based on actual usage of users in the system.

Additionally, note if your competition basing their pricing on:

- Set license fee vs revenue share
	- Example: $399/month or 2% of revenue. This type of model implies that your business is focusing on small and growing customer size. Any business that has established cash flow and significant volume, will want a predetermined license fee. The bigger the customer, the more they tend to hate revenue share models. See Note #2 at the bottom for more.
	- This model is good when aiming to be the low cost or catering to entry level users who do not have enough use to justify an set license fee.
    
- Number of users / seats
	- Example: $10 for up to 3 users.  Note what message this sends. Similar to the implication of the Pay As You Go plan, if the top plan offers 10 seats, then that's the largest prospect they are effectively targeting.  See Note #1 at the bottom for more.
    
- Specific features locked / unlocked
   - Example: You get X in the basic package but X and Y in the advanced package. Keep an eye out on what features are locked into the more expensive packages.

>Personal Anecdote: I was looking at a digital signature solution. I found one with a great entry level plan, which fit my projected use. The plans were based on the hybrid of transactions and additional features. One of my requirement was that it would sync to Salesforce. As soon as I added the Salesforce integration requirement, I got bumped into the Enterprise package, that cost 20x the entry level. They lost my business because they used "Salesforce" integration as way to split small business from Enterprise, without accounting for Salesforce being the most popular CRM.
   
- Transactions / Actions Performed
   - Example: 100,000 emails per month
- Support tiers
    - Example: Forum, Email, Phone, SLA
    - Note any references to type of support or service level guarantees provided. Companies that target larger business will often highlight support responses and SLAs. 

> Personal Anecdote: I was looking for a vendor to host some videos that had special player requirements. One looked promising so I sent over some questions. This is a quote from the response "We don’t actually have a team that supports Pro sales or account management currently."   There is nothing wrong with a full self-service model, but if you're selling to other businesses some human to talk to customers is generally helpful.
    
- Training
	- Any training (outside of pre-recorded videos) is usually a sign of targeting larger customers.
- Integrations into 3rd parties and API access
	- Note which platforms have available integrations.
	- Example: In the eCommerce space having an integration into Shopify means that the company is targetting SMB segment but an integration into Hybris means the target is high-volume merchants doing millions in annual revenue.


>Remember your pricing sends a very specific message to the prospect.



- **Note #1: License Free vs Revenue Share**
    - Revenue share is always attractive to the SMB as they don’t have to commit payment for something that may not work for them or something that may take a while for them to ramp up to get full use.  They are much happier to pay for something after they used the product. 
    - An established company, with budgets and managers approval, that’s already doing significant volume isn’t interesting in giving up 1% of their revenue. It’s almost a non-starter for them.  They want to know what their monthly fee is going to be, so they can budget for it and expect to pay it every month. 

> This is a quote from ChannelAdvisor's 2015 Q1 earnings report: *"Fixed subscription fees were 78 percent of total revenue and variable subscription fees were 22 percent of total revenue for the first quarter of 2015. This compares to 73 percent and 27 percent, respectively, for the first quarter of 2014."* [Source](http://www.channeladvisor.com/channeladvisor-announces-first-quarter-2015-financial-results/)  
As you can see, their customers are forcing them into switching to license fee from revenue share.

- **Note #2: Transaction Tiers**
	- Transactions / Actions Performed signals exactly what kind of company is in your sweet spot for support.  Let’s say you break up your pricing package to  be
     - Entry: Up to 1,000 transactions
     - Growth: Up to 5,000 transactions
     - Plus: Up to 10,000 transactions
     
This means that if I’m a smaller business, doing 200 – 800 transactions a month I may look and think that you’re too big for me since I fall to the smaller side of your smallest plan. On the other other hand, if I am a big customer, I see that your max plan is 10,000 and even if you have a note “for larger customers call us” I know that if I am doing 20,000 transactions, I’m twice your largest package and I can assume you may struggle to support me from a technology and other standpoint.


# Costs

> **Key Points**

> 1.   Make sure your price makes you money after all costs are factored in.

## Figure out the total cost of product

It maybe too early in the development of your product to properly calculate the cost of creating the product, lifetime value of a customer and cost of sale but you should at least try to keep in mind different costs that eventually the product revenue needs to cover. 

1. Infrastructure costs, including your own vendors for development (software licenses, uptime monitoring, analytics, etc)
2. Promotion and marketing costs
3. Staff salaries
4. Commissions for sales team (if applicable)
5. General overhead and office space
6. Credit card processing costs

So how many customers do you need at $10/month to cover all that? 

As an example of the above list you can do back of the envelope math as following:

- A server costs me $X per month and can handle Z customers which means my monthly infrastrucure cost per customer is X/Z  (Recurring cost)
- On average it costs me $Y to acquire each new paying customer (One time cost)
- I have a staff of Z at total monthly payroll of ABC. How many paying customers to do I need to be able to cover the cost of payroll? (Recurring cost)


# Other Considerations

> **Key Points**

> 1.  Try to use all available inforation about your potential customers to come up with an acceptable pricing strategy

> 2.  Pricing sends a message, be on the lookout for when the wrong messages


This is a collections of a few quick ideas to keep in mind before you get to the actual pricing considerations.

### What else is the customer buying?
One of the key customer insights that many miss, is to find out what else the customer is paying for and see if you can back out some of their decisions based on that. As an example, let's say you are targeting e-commerce retailers. E-commerce shopping carts generally come in two options 

1. Hosted - (BigCommerce, Shopify) - The cart is entire hosted for the retailer. They are sacrificing some flexibility in exchange for not having their own development/IT staff and infrastructure. These products have low startup costs and monthly fees are often based on revenue share, attracting newer / smaller businesses.
2. Owned - (Magento) - The cart code is licensed  to the merchant who customizes and hosts it themselves. This generally requires them to have their own hardware and staff to manage the cart or pay someone to do it for them. This generally attracts bigger merchants with a budet for software.

Just by asking your potential customers what else they've bought or what platforms they have in place, you can make key decisions based on those insights. By asking what cart they are using, you just backed out the following information:

- Do they have IT staff and infrastructure?
-- Which actually also leads to overall budget estimates
- Are they willing to spend money to get projects off the ground
- Do they prefer to sacrifice features for "it just works"
- Are they open to a monthly rev share fee or prefer licensing fees
- What kind of sales process they are familiar with
-- Magento is high-touch, sales person driven
-- Shopify is self-serve signup
   

### Implication of Decisions

Be careful of pricing getting too complex. You can maximize revenue by segmenting your customer base, but the way you gate your product needs to be conveyed clearly in the prices.  As you segment your pricing remember, price sensitive customers get limited plans, value sensitive customers get the VIP plan. 

Too few tiers leaves cash on the table but too many tiers are just as bad at confusing customers.

You pricing point will determine wether you need a no-touch, low-touch or a high-touch sales operation. Are you interested in a business with fewer, high margin customers or a mass, lower margin offering?
