## Figure out the total cost of product

It maybe too early in the development of your product to properly calculate the cost of creating the product, lifetime value of a customer and cost of sale but you should at least try to keep in mind different costs that eventually the product revenue needs to cover. 

1. Infrastructure costs, including your own vendors for development (software licenses, uptime monitoring, analytics, etc)
2. Promotion and marketing costs
3. Staff salaries
4. Commissions for sales team (if applicable)
5. General overhead and office space
6. Credit card processing costs

So how many customers do you need at $10/month to cover all that? 

As an example of the above list you can do back of the envelope math as following:

- A server costs me $X per month and can handle Z customers which means my monthly infrastrucure cost per customer is X/Z  (Recurring cost)
- On average it costs me $Y to acquire each new paying customer (One time cost)
- I have a staff of Z at total monthly payroll of ABC. How many paying customers to do I need to be able to cover the cost of payroll? (Recurring cost)
