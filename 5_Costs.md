## Figure out the total cost of product

It maybe too early in the development of your product to properly calculate the cost of creating the product, lifetime value of a customer and cost of sale but you should at least try to keep in mind different costs that eventually the product revenue needs to cover. 

1. Infrastructure Costs
2. Promotional Costs
3. Marketing Salaries
4. Development Salaries
5. Sales Salaries (and Commissions)
6. Support Team Salaries
7. General Overhead

Be very careful is taking advice along the lines "Well, if the cost of acquisition that you pay is below your customer value, it's a great way to promote the product". Yes, that's great but what about covering the rest of the costs associated with that customer.

As an example of the above list you can do back of the envelope math as following:

- A server costs me $X per month and can handle Z customers which means my monthly infrastrucure cost per customer is X/Z  (Recurring cost)
- On average it costs me $Y to acquire each new paying customer (One time cost)
- I have a staff of Z at total monthly payroll of ABC. How many paying customers to do I need to be able to cover the cost of payroll? (Recurring cost)
