## Figure out the total cost of product

It maybe too early in the development of your product to properly calculate the cost of creating the product and getting it sold but you should at least try to keep in mind different costs that eventually the product revenue needs to cover. 

1. Infrastructure Costs
2. Promotion Campaign Cost
3. Marketing Salaries
4. Development Salaries
5. Sales Salaries (and Commissions)
6. Support Team Salaries
7. General Overhead

Be very careful is taking advice that very often comes from many along the lines "Well, if the cost of acquisition that you pay is below your customer value, it's a great way to promote the product". Yes, that's great but what about covering the rest of the costs.

As an example of the above list you can do back of the envelope math as following:

- A server costs me $X per month and can handle Xa customers which means my monthly infrastrucure cost per customer is X/Xa (Recurring cost)
- On average it costs me $Y to acquire each new paying customer (One time cost)
- I have a staff of Z at total monthly payroll of Za. How many paying customers to do I need to be able to cover the cost of payroll? (A cost that has to be amortized over time but also covered).

Try to calculate a break even point for your business.
