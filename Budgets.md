Now that you’ve identified your typical customer, build out a sample P&L for them. It’s easy to skip this step, but don’t. This will help you gage if your pricing makes sense and keep you on the right path.  Using the average size business you are targeting, estimate’s their typical gross margins, other expenses to arrive to the first data point we need:

If I was a potential customer, given my business’s profitability and operations, how much can I possibly spend on this product?

Let’s do this as a concrete example, and you becoming a hypothetical e-mail provider example. 

You’ve decided to target e-commerce merchants who are established, growing fast and doing between $10M and $20M in annual revenue. 

**Revenue $10M at 40% gross margin**
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>P&L Line</th>
            <th>Ammount</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Gross Revenue</td>
            <td>$10M</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Gross Profit</td>
            <td>$4M</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Net Margin</td>
            <td>20%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Profit</td>
            <td>$2M</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Good news, you don’t need to be thinking about pennies as clearly a typical customer is operating with healthy margin and should be able to afford to pay for a service that will improve their business.

However, let’s say you you made the decision that you want to get the customers while they are small and have them grow with you. You’re targeting retailers who are doing 500K in annual revenue as your ideal customer.

**Revenue of $500,000 at 40% gross margin**
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>P&L Line</th>
            <th>Ammount</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Gross Revenue</td>
            <td>$500,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Gross Profit</td>
            <td>$200,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Net Margin</td>
            <td>5%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Profit</td>
            <td>$25,000</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table> 

In this case, you better believe that the owner is going to sweat the difference between $50 and $150 dollars a month so you have to price your solution significantly cheaper to get traction in this market and you’re going to have to be dealing with significantly more price conscious crowd.

This is just one example of why proper market positioning and pricing alignment is important. You can’t go after the entry level business at $500 a month or after growing businesses at $50 a month in both cases you’ll find your self priced out of the sale because in one cause you’re too expensive, in the other case, you seem so cheap that the prospect assumes its only because you are lacking something.
