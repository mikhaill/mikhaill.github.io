title: B2B Saas Pricing Intro

Developing a proper pricing structure for B2B SaaS software products is especially complicated. Pricing has many requirements and figuring out how to get it right isn’t easy. It takes plenty of trials and errors. Getting pricing correct is extremely important because it determines the length of your sales cycle, the decision makers, positions you in the marketplace, sets customers expectations and has to keep you profitable.

SaaS solutions are attractive to customers because they reduce the upfront investment and avoid the ongoing costs of maintaining the hardware and the software. With a SaaS solution, those costs and risks are transferred to the software developer, so it’s important that the pricing structure accounts for this.

Besides having many implications, pricing also has to work for all the stakeholders:

- Prospects and Customers – It has to align with your customers business models
- Messaging – Pricing messages to prospects what kind of customer you’re looking for and it has to align with your product marketing message
- Market Position– Competition, substitutions and customer’s lifecycle have to be taken into account for setting your pricing. 
- Changes – Customers do not like change, especially when it’s a price increase

There is no simple formula or a 3-step process to help with pricing you product. I hope to show the different approaches and implications of various decisions to help you form a solid foundation for coming up with a pricing strategy for your products.  A pricing strategy is something that can’t be figured out in an hour, it requires research and analysis. 

The one assumption I’m making is that you already know the product positioning for your offering.

Before we can talk pricing, there needs to be a clear product marketing position that pricing supports. If you haven’t figured out your product positioning, do it now, because a misalignment between pricing and position will quickly kill your sales.

Product positioning is an important part of a product marketing strategy.  If you try to be everything to everyone, you may not succeed with anyone.  A specific position helps buyers understand where the product fits in terms what it offers, and how it compares with the competition. 

As an example, let’s look at the e-mail service space for an example of product positioning:

- [Listrak](http://www.listrak.com) -  has positioned themselves as e-mail for e-commerce merchants and retailers
- [Mad Mimi](http://www.madmimi.com) - focuses on offering a simple way to create branded, well-designed newsletters
- [HubSpot](http://www.hubspot.com) - focuses on helping businesses do inbound marketing and generate sales leads
- [Marketo](http://www.marketo.com) - positioned itself as the platform for nurturing prospects to deal close and customer loyalty

As you can see, all of the companies here are e-mail services providers and probably have a large overlap in their features. However, by positioning their product for a specific niche, and tweaking their specific features they are able to carve out a space to operate and generate profits from it.

If you haven’t thought about product positioning, now is the time to do it.  There are many other wonderful resources on product positioning and marketing.

Let me give you two warning as you think about your product positioning. Do not let pricing be your differentiation. There will always be someone who will find a way to undercut you and offer a similar set of features cheaper than you can.  Please try to find a different way to position yourself other than price.

Have a clear decision on if you’re going to be a premium product in the marketplace or not.  A premium product at a higher cost may require a sales team, which means additional hiring, costs, commission, etc. A premium product also comes with certain assumptions such account managers, phone support, etc. This isn’t to discourage you from pricing at a premium, if that’s how you’re planning to build your business but be aware of the implications.
